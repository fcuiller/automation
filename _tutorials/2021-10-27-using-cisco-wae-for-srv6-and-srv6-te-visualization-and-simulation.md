title: Using Cisco WAE for SRv6 and SRv6 TE visualization and simulation
---
## Introduction

Cisco WAN Automation Engine release 7.5 introduces the capability for modeling SRv6 and FlexAlgo. However, this initial phase relies on  Crosswork Optimization Engine 3.0 and later for collection and model building. In the tutorial [Using Cisco WAE to run simulation on network models](https://xrdocs.io/automation/tutorials/using-cisco-wae-to-run-sim-on-network-models-from-OE/) from Crosswork Optimization Engine, we provided an example on the steps required to retrieve the network model built using the Crosswork Optimization Engine.



The Cisco Crossworkâ„¢ Optimization Engine is a key component of the Crosswork Automation Suite. It 
provides real-time network optimization capabilities that allow operators to effectively maximize network utility and increase service velocity using real-time traffic engineering and proactive optimization.
