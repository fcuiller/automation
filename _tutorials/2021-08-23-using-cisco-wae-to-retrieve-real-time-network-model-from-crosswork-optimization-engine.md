## Introduction

The Cisco Crossworkâ„¢ Optimization Engine is a key component of the Crosswork Automation Suite. It 
provides real-time network optimization capabilities that allow operators to effectively maximize network utility and increase service velocity using real-time traffic engineering and proactive optimization.

Crosswork Optimization Engine is an effective tool for creating network intent through the implementation and visualization of Segment Routing Traffic Engineering (SR-TE) policies and for addressing transient network congestion through Local Congestion Mitigation (LCM). 

The WAN Automation Engine (WAE) works hand-in-hand with Crosswork Optimization Engine to address  requirements of different aspects of capacity management, ranging from long term network engineering to capacity planning and traffic engineering. The WAN Automation Engine is also useful for simulation analysis, in determining potential network hotspots during failure scenarios. 

This tutorial demonstrates how the real-time network model in Crosswork Optimization Engine can be retrieved and used in WAN Automation Engine for capacity management and simulation analysis purposes.
